Write a JavaScript function that takes a sentence as an argument
  and determines which word in that sentence has the greatest number of repeated letters.

  split on " " first => words

  split on "" = > words to letter array

  ck for uniqueness by comparing each letter and incrementing a count  =  count || 0

  function wordSelector(string){

}




If the sentence has multiple words with the same max of repeated letters,
return them all in an Array.






Test Case:

wordSelector("I attribute my success to this: I never gave or took any excuse. â€“Florence Nightingale")
Would select the words:

["attribute", "success"]
